# recipes

This isn't a software repository, but instead a document one. My intention is to
make sharing recipes that I like and use easy as well as to incorporate suggested
recipes from friends.

Contributions are welcome from anyone. I will only use vegan recipes. My preference
is for recipes with short ingredient lists, but I can make exceptions. Recipes that
are contributed must be free of any legal (copyright law) restrictions.
