# Simple Raisin Bread

This recipe has been passed down and modified through several people. I learned
how to make it from James Prest, who learned from Isaac Privett, who learned
through either his brothers or directly from Jennita Schmidt, and after that I
don't know where the recipe came from.

## Ingredients

	18 Cups (5 lbs)       : Whole Wheat Flour
	1 Tablespoon          : Yeast
	5 1/4 - 5 1/2 Cups    : Hot Water
	1 Tablespoon          : Salt
	1 Can                 : Grape Juice Concentrate
	3 Cups (or to liking) : Raisins

## Directions

1. Combine water, grape juice concentrate and yeast together in a large enough
   bowl. If the water is too hot after adding the grape juice concentrate wait
   for it to cool off to at least 115 degrees F or until it is not burning your
   fingers on initial contact. Stir together and let sit until the yeast rises
   back to the top of the liquid.
2. Mix in the flour, salt and raisins thoroughly after step 1 is complete.
3. Cover the dough and let it rise for 30 minutes, knead it, let it rise
   another 30 minutes, knead again, shape the dough into loaves and place it in
   bread pans. Let it rise 15 minutes before sticking into the oven.
4. Place the loaves in the oven pre-heated to 350 degrees F for 35 - 50 minutes
   or until the bread turns to a golden brown.

## Yield

Typically 6 loaves.
