# Carob Chip Cookies

I modified [this recipe](http://bakerbettie.com/chocolate-chip-cookies-without-baking-soda-or-baking-powder/)
for baking soda free chocolate chip cookies to being carob chip cookies. As of
now this recipe uses Ener-G Egg Replacer which has calcium carbonate in it, so
the recipe doesn't have proper pH balance yet.

## Ingredients

	1  stick       : unsalted butter
	1/2 cup        : granulated sugar
	1/4 cup        : brown sugar
	1              : egg (may replace with Ener-G Egg Replacer or other egg substitute)
	2 teaspoon     : pure vanilla extract
	1/2  teaspoon  : salt
	1 1/4 cup      : all-purpose flour
	1 cup          : carob chips

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2. In a large bowl with either a hand mixer or stand mixer, cream together the
   butter and sugars until fluffy. Then add egg and vanilla extract.
3. Mix salt and then flour in small amounts. Fold in the carob chips.
4. Scoop cookies onto cookie sheets. Use a large scoop for this.
5. Bake at 350 degrees F until edges are set, then remove from oven and let
   cool, preferably on wire racks.

## Yield

Approximately 10-12 cookies depending on size of scoop.
