# Vegan Macaroni and Cheese

This recipe originally came from Seven Secrets by Neva and Jim Brackett. I've 
modified it slightly due to it slightly upsetting my stomach.

## Ingredients

### Sauce

	1/4 Cup       : Raw Cashew Pieces
	1/4 Cup       : Nutritional Yeast
	1/4 Cup       : Cornstarch
	1/4 Cup       : Pimentos
	1 Can         : Coconut Milk
	2 Tablespoons : Lemon Juice
	2 Teaspoons   : Salt
	1 Teaspoon    : Onion Powder
	1 1/4 Cup     : Water

### Pasta

3 Cups : Dry Macaroni

## Directions

1. Blend all the ingredients for the sauce together. If you have a weak blender,
   it may be best to blend the cashews to a fine powder first and then adding
   all the other ingredients.
2. Cook the macaroni, probably best to start this before everything else, and
   drain the water after it is cooked, keep or return to the pot.
3. Add sauce to the macaroni and cook until the sauce has thickened.

## Yield

About 6 servings.
