Recipe found originally on Yumly.

## Ingredients

1 1/4 Cup	: Cooked Brown Basmati Rice
1 16 oz.	: Extra Firm Tofu
1 1/4 Cup	: Frozen Peas
1 1/4 Cup	: Carots (preferably less than 1 cubic centimeter in size)
3/4 Teaspoon	: Tumeric
5 Tablespoons	: Bragg's Liquid Aminos or preferred soy sauce.

## Directions

1. If you haven't already cook the rice.

   Add frozen peas with the carots and fry together until the carots soften
   to your liking.
3. Remove carots and peas from pan and set aside.
4. Add tofu to skillet. Tofu should be mashed up with a fork to turn it into
   bite size pieces. Add enough oil to keep it from sticking to the pan. Add
   tumeric while frying. Fry for about 5 minutes and remove.
5. Add rice to skillet and enough oil to keep it from sticking to the pan.
   After frying for a minute or two add all of your other fried ingredients
   back into the pan. At this point you add the Bragg's or soy sauce. Fry
   for a few more minutes.
6. Serve your now finished dish.
